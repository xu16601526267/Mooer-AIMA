# AIMA Text-to-Speech

Generate speech audio from text using the TTS model currently managed by AIMA/OpenClaw.

## When to use

- The user explicitly asks for a spoken or voice reply.
- The user asks you to say something aloud instead of only writing it.
- The user wants a short audio clip in Chinese or English.

## Required behavior

- Write a short spoken script first.
- Run `{baseDir}/scripts/speak.sh` with that script.
- After OpenClaw attaches the generated media, reply with exactly `NO_REPLY`.
- If TTS generation fails, give a brief text fallback that says the audio conversion failed.
- Keep the spoken script short and in the user's language unless they ask for something longer.

## Quick start

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/speak.sh "你好世界" --filename hello.wav
```

## Useful flags

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/speak.sh "今天天气真好" --filename weather.wav
{baseDir}/scripts/speak.sh "Hello AIMA" --filename greeting.wav --voice default
{baseDir}/scripts/speak.sh "请用参考音色说这句话" --api tts --reference-audio /tmp/ref.wav --reference-text "参考文案"
```

## Output

- WAV audio file saved to workspace
- `MEDIA:` line printed for OpenClaw auto-attachment

## Notes

- Model: auto-detected from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (override with `AIMA_TTS_MODEL`)
- Voice: `default` (single voice)
- API: `speech` (`/v1/audio/speech`) or `tts` (`/v1/tts`)
- Output format: configurable with `--response-format`
- Optional reference fields: `--reference-audio`, `--reference-text`
- Runs on AIMA proxy at `http://127.0.0.1:6188/v1`
