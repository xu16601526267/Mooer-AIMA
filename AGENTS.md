# AIMA — Development Guide

## What Is This

AIMA (AI-Inference-Managed-by-AI): a Go binary that manages AI inference on edge devices.
It detects hardware, resolves optimal configs from a YAML knowledge base, generates K3S Pod YAML,
and exposes MCP tools for AI Agents to operate everything. **This project is 100% developed by Claude Code.**

Tech: Go (no CGO), K3S, HAMi, SQLite (modernc.org/sqlite), MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0), Cobra CLI, log/slog.
Design docs: `design/ARCHITECTURE.md` (system architecture), `design/PRD.md`, `design/MRD.md`.

## Release Flow & Version Management

Current development line: **v0.3**. Latest product release: **v0.3.1**.

This project uses a **develop-based release flow** with a single declared development line.
The development line is recorded in `internal/buildinfo/series.txt`. Right now that value is `v0.3`.

```
master  ──●──── tag v0.2.0 ───────────────── tag v0.2.1 ──
          \                                  /
develop ───●──●──●──●──feature──●──●──●──●──●
                   \           /
                    feat/xxx──●
```

| Branch | Purpose | Merges to |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `master` | Production releases only. Every product release tag is created here. | — |
| `develop` | Main integration branch for the current development line (`v0.3`). | `master` (via `release/*`) |
| `feat/<name>` | New feature branch from `develop`. | `develop` |
| `fix/<name>` | Bug fix branch from `develop`. | `develop` |
| `docs/<name>` | Documentation-only branch from `develop`. | `develop` |
| `release/<ver>` | Release preparation branch for a concrete SemVer release such as `release/v0.2.1`. | `master` + `develop` |
| `hotfix/<ver>` | Urgent production fix from `master` for a concrete SemVer release. | `master` + `develop` |

### Version Taxonomy

- **Product version** — SemVer release tag `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Only annotated tags in this exact format count as AIMA releases.
- **Development line** — the active train for `develop` and feature work, currently `v0.3`.
- **Development build version** — `<development-line>-dev`, for example `v0.3-dev`. The exact commit is carried separately in build metadata.
- **MCP protocol version** — protocol compatibility only (for example `2024-11-05`), not the AIMA release number.
- **DB/import schema version** — internal compatibility counters (`PRAGMA user_version`, `schema_version`), never product release numbers.
- **Catalog/component version** — upstream dependency versions stored in YAML, not AIMA release numbers.
- **Asset bundle tag** — must use a separate namespace such as `assets/<date>` or `bundle/<name>/<date>`, never `vX.Y.Z-*`.

### Product Tag Rules

- Use **exactly one** product release tag per release commit.
- Product release tags must be **annotated**.
- Only `vX.Y.Z` tags are product releases.
- Do not create product-like suffix tags such as `v0.1.0-images` or duplicate aliases such as `v0.0.1-metax`.
- Codenames belong in the GitHub release title/notes, not in the tag name.

### SemVer Rules (Pre-1.0)

- **0.y.z minor** — user-visible capability additions, new MCP tools, new runtime behavior, or intentional CLI/MCP contract changes.
- **0.y.z patch** — bug fixes, catalog corrections, packaging fixes, and doc updates without intentional capability expansion.
- **1.0.0** — CLI/MCP contract and core deployment workflow are stable enough to be treated as a compatibility baseline.

### Development Line Rules

- `internal/buildinfo/series.txt` is the single source of truth for the active development line.
- As long as the team is iterating inside the current line, keep it at `v0.3`.
- All non-tagged builds from `develop`, `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, and `release/*` report `v0.3-dev`.
- When starting the next line, update `internal/buildinfo/series.txt` in `develop` first, for example `v0.3` → `v0.4`.
- Product releases remain exact SemVer tags such as `v0.2.1` or `v0.3.0`.

### Daily workflow

```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# ... develop, commit ...

# Push and create PR to develop
git push -u origin feat/my-feature
# Create PR: feat/my-feature → develop

# After PR merged, clean up
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feat/my-feature
```

### Release workflow

```bash
# Prepare a concrete release from the current development line
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v0.2.1

# Final fixes, changelog update, validation

# Merge to master and tag the release
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/v0.2.1
git tag -a v0.2.1 -m "Release v0.2.1"
git push origin master --tags

# Back-merge release fixes into develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v0.2.1
git push origin develop
```

### Build with version info

```bash
make build
./build/aima version
make version-audit
make bundle-tag
```

`make build` injects `Version`, `GitCommit`, and `BuildTime` into `internal/buildinfo`.
Only exact `vX.Y.Z` tags are treated as releases. Non-tagged builds report
`<development-line>-dev`, and the current line comes from `internal/buildinfo/series.txt`.
`make version-audit` prints product tags, legacy pseudo-release tags, and known migration targets.
`make bundle-tag` creates the local replacement bundle tag `bundle/stack/2026-02-26` without pushing it.

### Rules for AI Agents

- **Never force-push to `master`.**
- **Branch new work from `develop`, not from `master`.**
- **Keep `internal/buildinfo/series.txt` at `v0.3` until the team explicitly starts the next line.**
- **Only `vX.Y.Z` annotated tags are product releases.**
- **Do not invent new product-like suffix tags for assets, images, or vendor-specific bundles.**
- **Release through `release/<ver>` and tag on `master`.**

## The Prime Directive: Less Code

**Every line of Go code is a liability.** The goal is the smallest possible binary that glues
mature external tools (K3S, HAMi, containerd, SQLite) together with YAML knowledge.

- Before writing code, ask: "Can this be a YAML knowledge file instead?"
- Before adding a function, ask: "Does an existing tool/library already do this?"
- Before adding an abstraction, ask: "Do I have 3+ concrete uses, or am I guessing?"
- Before adding error handling, ask: "Can this actually happen, or am I being defensive?"
- 80% of capability expansion = writing YAML, not Go code.

## Architecture Invariants (Never Violate)

Read `design/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 for full list. The critical ones:

1. **INV-1/2: No code branches for engine/model types.** Engine behavior = YAML. Model metadata = YAML.
   Adding a new engine or model = writing YAML, zero Go code.
2. **INV-3: Don't manage container lifecycle.** K3S does it. AIMA only does: apply / get / delete / logs.
3. **INV-5: MCP tools are the single source of truth.** CLI wraps MCP tools. CLI never has logic
   that MCP tools don't. Agent and human always walk the same code path.
4. **INV-8: Offline-first.** All core functions must work with zero network. Network = enhancement, not requirement.

go build ./cmd/aima               # Quick local build without release metadata guarantees
go test ./...                      # Test all
go test -race ./...                # Test with race detector
go vet ./...                       # Static analysis

## Go Conventions for This Project

- **Zero CGO.** SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`. No C dependencies, ever.
- **Standard library first.** `net/http` not gin/echo. `log/slog` not zap/logrus. `encoding/json` not jsoniter.
- **Errors wrap with context:** `fmt.Errorf("resolve config for %s: %w", model, err)`.
- **Context as first param.** Every function that does I/O takes `context.Context`.
- **Interfaces at consumer, not provider.** Define interfaces where they're used, not where they're implemented.
- **Functional options for config:** `NewServer(addr, WithTimeout(5*time.Second))`.
- **No init(), no global state.** Everything is dependency-injected via struct constructors.
- **Table-driven tests.** Use `testdata/` for fixtures.

## Design Patterns to Follow

### The "Thin CLI" Pattern
Every CLI command is a thin wrapper: parse flags -> call MCP tool function -> format output.
CLI never contains business logic. If you need new logic, add it as an MCP tool first.

```go
// CORRECT: CLI calls MCP tool
func runDeploy(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    return mcpTools.DeployApply(ctx, engine, model, slot)
}

// WRONG: CLI contains logic
func runDeploy(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    hw := hal.Detect()
    config := knowledge.Resolve(hw, model)
    pod := knowledge.GeneratePod(config)
    return k3s.Apply(pod)  // This logic belongs in deploy.apply MCP tool
}
```

### The "Knowledge-Driven" Pattern
Don't hardcode behaviors per engine/model. Load them from YAML:

```go
// CORRECT: Knowledge-driven
engineAsset, _ := knowledge.FindEngine(engineType, gpuArch)
pod := podgen.Render(engineAsset, modelAsset, partitionSlot)

// WRONG: Code-driven
if engineType == "vllm" {
    pod.Image = "vllm/vllm-openai:latest"
    pod.Command = []string{"vllm", "serve"}
} else if engineType == "llamacpp" {
    // ...more branches for each engine...
}
```

### The "Graceful Degradation" Pattern
Every feature must handle absence of its dependencies:

```go
// L3a unavailable -> fall back to L2 -> fall back to L0
func (d *Dispatcher) Ask(ctx context.Context, query string) (string, error) {
    if d.goAgent.Available() {
        return d.goAgent.Ask(ctx, query)
    }
    return d.knowledgeResolve(ctx, query)  // L2 deterministic
}
```

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't write strategy/policy code in Go.** That's the Agent's job via MCP tools.
- **Don't add engine-specific or model-specific if/switch branches.** Use YAML knowledge.
- **Don't manage container lifecycle.** K3S handles health checks, restarts, resource limits.
- **Don't create abstractions "for the future."** Three concrete uses before abstracting.
- **Don't add comments to code you didn't change.** Don't add docstrings unless the function is exported and non-obvious.
- **Don't create wrapper types around standard library types.** Use `*sql.DB` directly, not `type Database struct { db *sql.DB }` unless there's a real reason.
- **Don't add metrics/tracing/logging infrastructure preemptively.** `slog.Info()` is enough until proven otherwise.
- **Don't create separate files for single types or tiny functions.** Keep related code together.

## Workflow

1. **Read before writing.** Always read existing code before modifying. Understand the pattern first.
2. **Architecture doc is source of truth.** When in doubt, consult `design/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. **Test what matters.** Test business logic and edge cases. Don't test that Go's JSON marshaling works.
4. **One MCP tool = one function = one responsibility.** Keep tool implementations focused.
5. **Commit atomically.** Each commit should be a coherent, working unit.
6. **Branch from develop.** Never commit directly to master. Feature branches merge to develop via PR.

## MCP Tools for Benchmarking & Knowledge Transfer

### Benchmark Workflow (Agent Guidance)

After deploying a model, establish performance baselines using the benchmark tools:

```
1. benchmark.run   — Single benchmark run against a deployed model
                     Auto-detects endpoint from proxy; measures TTFT/TPOT/TPS
                     Results auto-saved to DB when hardware + engine provided

2. benchmark.matrix — Test matrix: concurrency × input_len × output_len
                      Runs benchmark.run for each combination sequentially
                      Use for comprehensive performance characterization

3. benchmark.list   — Query historical benchmark results
                      Filter by model, hardware, engine, or config ID

4. benchmark.record — Manually record external benchmark measurements
```

### Knowledge Export/Import Workflow (Agent Guidance)

Share tuning knowledge across devices using export/import:

```
1. knowledge.export — Export configs + benchmarks + notes to JSON
                      Filter by --hardware, --model, --engine
                      No filter = full DB dump
                      Output to file (--output) or stdout

2. knowledge.import — Import from JSON file
                      Conflict: skip (default) | overwrite
                      Supports --dry-run preview
                      Atomic transaction (all-or-nothing)
```

Typical cross-device flow:
```bash
# On device A (has benchmark data)
aima knowledge export --hardware nvidia-gb10-arm64 -o gb10.json

# Transfer file to device B
scp gb10.json user@device-b:/tmp/

# On device B (import knowledge)
aima knowledge import -i /tmp/gb10.json --dry-run   # preview first
aima knowledge import -i /tmp/gb10.json              # commit
```

Export JSON format (schema_version: 1):
```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "data": {
    "configurations": [...],    // Hardware×Engine×Model configs
    "benchmark_results": [...], // Performance measurements (FK → configurations)
    "knowledge_notes": [...]    // Agent exploration notes
  },
  "stats": { "configurations": N, "benchmark_results": N, "knowledge_notes": N }
}
```
